# Sad Chill Bot

##### **Old:** *Sad Chill Bot (SCB) is a bot I made for one Discord server, it was originaly supposed to be a joke bot it is now a joke and moderator bot.*

**New:** Sad Chill Bot (SCB) is a bot that will have multiple **moderation** and **fun** commands. It's in heavy early release, but I will try my hardest to make a great bot. I'm only coding SCB with my spare time, *mostly when I'm bored*.


## Roadmap

- All of the commands ported over from [**Discord.JS**](https://discord.js.org) v11/v12 to v14
  - maybe only some lol

- Any extra commands that I *or others* find necessary
